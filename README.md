# CoastPay Fleet Card: Smart Fuel Management, Transparent Pricing, Real-Time Control

So you're running a fleet—whether it's five vans or fifty trucks—and fuel costs are eating into your margins faster than you can track them. You've probably dealt with the usual headaches: drivers fueling at who-knows-where, receipts that disappear into the void, and fleet cards that come with more hidden fees than a cell phone contract from 2005.

That's where CoastPay comes in. Think of it as the fleet card that actually makes sense—no PhD in fine print required.

## What Actually Is CoastPay?

CoastPay (or just "Coast" if we're being casual) launched in 2020 with a pretty straightforward mission: build a fleet card that doesn't make you want to throw your computer out the window. Founded by Daniel Simon in New York City, the company has raised $77 million from some heavy-hitter investors like Accel, Insight Partners, and Iconiq Capital.

But here's what matters more than the funding rounds: Coast runs on the Visa network, which means your drivers can fuel up at pretty much any gas station in America. No more "sorry boss, I had to drive 20 minutes out of my way to find an approved station" excuses. Just gas, go, and get back to work.

## The Pricing Thing (Finally, Someone Just Tells You)

You know what's refreshing? A company that actually tells you what things cost without making you fill out a form and wait for a "personalized quote" (translation: we're going to charge you whatever we think you'll pay).

Coast's pricing is almost suspiciously simple:

| Plan Feature | Coast Pricing |
|-------------|---------------|
| Monthly Fee per Active User | $4 |
| Setup Fee | $0 |
| Annual Fee | $0 |
| Card Production & Shipping | Free (standard) |
| Transaction Fees | $0 |
| Per-Gallon Admin Fees | $0 |
| Reporting/Portal Access Fees | $0 |

"Active user" just means any card that made at least one transaction that month. If a card sits in a drawer unused, you don't pay for it. Shockingly reasonable, right?

**The Fine Print (Because It Exists)**

- Late payment fee: Greater of $35 or 2.5% of past-due amount
- If still unpaid after 31 days: Additional $35 or 5% of overdue balance
- Returned payment: $35 flat fee
- International transactions: 2.5% fee after USD conversion
- Expedited shipping: Available if you need cards faster

One important thing: Coast is a charge card, not a credit card. That means you pay your full balance each billing cycle—no carrying balances month-to-month. For some businesses, that's perfect. For others juggling cash flow, it's something to plan for.

## Where You Actually Save Money

The $4/month fee is nice and all, but you're probably thinking, "cool, but what about fuel costs?" Fair question.

### Fuel Rebates That Actually Add Up

Coast offers rebates at over 30,000 partner stations across the US. Here's how it breaks down:

- **Partner stations**: 3¢-9¢ per gallon back (sometimes up to 10¢ regionally)
- **Non-partner stations**: 1¢ per gallon back
- **Non-fuel purchases**: 1% cash back (no caps, no tiers)

Partner stations include big names like Exxon, Mobil, Shell, 7-Eleven, Circle K, Speedway, Casey's, RaceTrac, Maverik, and Stripes. Basically, if you've heard of it, it's probably a partner.

Let's do some quick math: A fleet of 10 vehicles averaging 15,000 miles/year at 15 MPG burns about 10,000 gallons annually per vehicle (100,000 gallons total). At an average 5¢/gallon rebate, that's $5,000 back. Minus your $480 annual fees ($4 × 10 cards × 12 months), you're still up $4,520. And that's before we count the time savings from not manually tracking receipts.

### Non-Fuel Discounts (The Bonus Round)

Remember how Coast works anywhere Visa does? That extends beyond gas stations. Your drivers can use their cards for:

- Vehicle maintenance and repairs
- Car washes and parking
- Job supplies and equipment
- Restaurants and hotels (if you allow it)

And you get 1% cash back on all of it. Plus, Coast has negotiated some pretty solid discounts with suppliers:

| Supplier | Discount |
|----------|----------|
| Schneider Electric | Up to 40% off |
| HD Supply | Up to 25% off |
| Grainger | Up to 24% off |
| Home Depot | Up to 22% off |
| Ferguson, ABB, United Rentals | Up to 20% off |
| Graybar, AirGas | Up to 18% off |

## The Control Freak's Dream (In a Good Way)

Here's where Coast gets interesting if you've ever had that sinking feeling when you see a $200 fuel charge at 2 AM from a truck that should be parked.

### What You Can Control

- **Spending limits**: By day, week, or month
- **Merchant categories**: Fuel only? Fuel + maintenance? Your call
- **Location restrictions**: GPS-based controls to prevent fraud
- **Time restrictions**: Because why would anyone need to fuel at 3 AM unless they're actually driving
- **Odometer requirements**: Can mandate odometer readings at purchase
- **Instant virtual cards**: Issue cards to seasonal workers, deactivate when done

The GPS thing is clever—integrate Coast with telematics like Samsara, Geotab, or Verizon Connect, and transactions get automatically declined if the vehicle isn't actually at the pump. It's like a fraud prevention system that actually prevents fraud instead of just notifying you after the fact.

### Real-Time Everything

Every transaction hits your dashboard immediately. No waiting for statements. No surprises. Just "John fueled up at Shell on I-95, 45 gallons, $3.89/gallon, vehicle odometer 47,832." 

You can set up text alerts too, if you're the type who likes knowing the second something happens (no judgment).

## What People Are Actually Saying

Coast has a 4.9/5 rating on Capterra with over 100 reviews. Let's look at what actual users say:

**Shane E., Facilities Services**: "Coast has really helped us get our fleet spending on track and organized as well as under control! The customer service and perks with Coast are legendary and like no other competitor I've found offers."

**Randall J., Fleet Manager**: "This card has saved us thousands overall. Incredibly low monthly fees, locks after usage to avoid theft if card is lost or forgotten."

**Michele R., Transportation Owner**: "The setup was very easy, it integrated with our other systems for fleet management and started working right away."

Common themes in reviews:
- Setup is genuinely easy (multiple reviewers mentioned this)
- Customer service is responsive and helpful
- The platform is intuitive enough that you don't need a manual
- Integration with existing systems (QuickBooks, accounting software, fleet management) actually works

The most common complaint? People wish there were more loyalty perks like fuel discount programs at more stations. Fair enough, though the rebates kind of serve that purpose.

## The Tech Side (For Accounting Teams Who Care)

Coast integrates with tools you're probably already using:

**Accounting**: QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Desktop, NetSuite, Sage Intacct
**Fleet Management**: Fleetio, WhipAround
**Telematics**: Samsara, Geotab, Verizon Connect, Azuga
**Field Service**: BuildOps

The accounting integrations auto-categorize transactions and let you push complete transactions (receipts included) with one click. The fleet management integrations automatically send fuel and maintenance data to your platform. The telematics integrations use GPS to verify transactions and flag suspicious activity.

Basically, it all talks to each other so you don't have to manually enter the same data three times.

## Security Stuff (Because Fraud Sucks)

Coast includes:

- EMV chip technology (standard nowadays)
- GPS auto-decline (requires telematics integration)
- SMS-based card unlock at pump
- Driver verification requirements
- Real-time transaction alerts
- Up to $25,000 annual fraud protection guarantee

The fraud guarantee is interesting—it covers both external fraud (stolen cards) and internal fraud (employees doing sketchy stuff), assuming you're using Coast's security features properly.

## Who Coast Works Best For

**Good fit if you:**
- Run a local service or delivery business (plumbing, HVAC, construction, landscaping, etc.)
- Have 5+ vehicles that need regular fueling
- Want flexibility on where drivers can fuel
- Need controls but don't want to micromanage every transaction
- Can pay statements in full each billing cycle
- Are structured as a corporation, LLC, or partnership

**Not ideal if you:**
- Are a sole proprietor (Coast doesn't approve these structures)
- Need to carry balances month-to-month (it's a charge card)
- Primarily fuel at one brand and that brand has a better proprietary card
- Need super complex expense approval workflows

## How It Stacks Up Against Competitors

Quick comparison with other popular fleet cards:

| Feature | Coast | AtoB | WEX | RoadFlex |
|---------|-------|------|-----|----------|
| Monthly Fee | $4/active card | $3-6/card | $4/card | $3/card basic |
| Network | Visa (everywhere) | Mastercard | 95% of stations | Visa |
| Fuel Rebates | 3-9¢/gal partners, 1¢ all others | Higher at truck stops | 1-15¢/gal | 2¢ everywhere, more at partners |
| Non-Fuel Cashback | 1% everywhere | Varies | Limited | 1% |
| Fraud Protection | $25K/year | $250K | Included | Included |
| Best For | Local fleets, gas stations | Trucking, truck stops | Large established fleets | Cost-conscious fleets |

Coast sits in a sweet spot for fleets that prioritize flexibility and simplicity over chasing the absolute maximum discount on fuel. If your drivers fuel at different stations regularly, the broad acceptance matters more than an extra penny per gallon at one specific brand.

## The Application Process (Allegedly Simple)

Coast says some applications get approved in minutes. Others take 3-5 business days if they need more documentation. You'll need:

- Business formation documents
- EIN (tax ID number)
- Beneficial ownership information (new requirement as of 2024)
- Basic business info (revenue, number of vehicles, etc.)

No personal guarantee required, which is nice if you'd prefer to keep business and personal finances separate. 

Once approved, cards ship free via standard shipping (5-10 business days). Need them faster? Express shipping is available for a fee.

## Real Talk: Is Coast Worth It?

Look, no fleet card is perfect for everyone. But Coast does a few things really well:

1. **Transparency**: They tell you what things cost upfront, in plain English, on their website. Revolutionary, I know.

2. **Flexibility**: Visa acceptance means drivers aren't route-planning around approved stations, which saves time and fuel.

3. **Modern platform**: The dashboard is actually intuitive. Integrations actually work. Mobile app actually functions. These should be table stakes, but you'd be surprised.

4. **Real-time controls**: Set limits, get alerts, prevent fraud before it happens instead of discovering it three weeks later.

5. **Reasonable pricing**: $4/month per active card is competitive, especially with no transaction fees or hidden charges.

The charge card structure (pay in full each cycle) is either a feature or a bug depending on your cash flow situation. If you can swing it, it encourages good financial discipline. If cash flow is tight, it might stress you out.

Bottom line: If you run a local fleet (5-50 vehicles, mostly gas stations, mix of fuel and non-fuel expenses), Coast is probably worth a serious look. The time you save on expense tracking alone might justify the cost.

## How to Get Started

The process is straightforward:

1. 👉 [Apply online](https://coastpay.com) (takes about 10 minutes)
2. Get approved (minutes to a few days)
3. Add your vehicles and drivers to the platform
4. Set your card rules and spending controls
5. Cards arrive, team starts using them
6. Watch the data flow into your dashboard

Coast also offers a demo if you want to poke around the platform before committing. Probably worth doing if you're switching from another provider and want to see if the interface actually lives up to the hype.

## The Verdict

Fleet cards shouldn't be complicated. You need something that helps you track spending, prevents fraud, saves a bit on fuel, and doesn't nickel-and-dime you with fees. Coast delivers on all of those without requiring a background in parsing legal documents.

Is it the absolute cheapest option? Depends on your fuel patterns. Is it the most feature-rich? Probably not. But it's the one that balances simplicity, flexibility, and functionality in a way that makes it easy to actually use.

For fleet managers who are tired of wasting time on expense reports and want to focus on, you know, managing the fleet—it's worth checking out.
